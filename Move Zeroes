In this question, An array is given : nums, we have move the non zero number in front of the array and zero at trailing positions

class Solution:
     
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        # i is the iterator to track the non zero numbers
        i = 0
        length = len(nums)
        
        # here we are moving i to the first zeroth position
        while i < length and nums[i] != 0:
            i += 1
        
        # index move from first zero place to end of array
        for index in range(i,len(nums)):
    
            # This while loop move index to the available zero place
            while nums[index] != 0:
                index = index + 1

            while i < length and nums[i] == 0:
                i += 1
            
            # Swapping zero to non zero number
            if i < length and index < length:
