# In this problem there is a single integer which is unique and rest are two in number we have to find the that unique number

class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # As the list constraint is non empty, i have taken the minimum list length as 1
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return nums[0]
        # the Counter of the module Collection has been used which is kind of hashmap 
        count = Counter(nums)
        # this is just searching in the counter
        for key in count.keys():
            if count[key] == 1:
                return key
